INSTALLATION

 o) You will need to add a new table to the pf config file. You can do so
    by adding lines to the pf.conf similar to these:

 table <bruteforce> persist file "/var/db/ssh-bruteforce"
 block in log quick proto tcp from <bruteforce> to any port ssh

 o) You will also need to add new line into your /etc/syslog.conf so it
    will look like this:

 auth.info;authpriv.info		| exec /usr/local/sbin/bruteforceblocker

    - note that you should keep the original line, otherwise you will lose
      your sshd's logs - e.g. they will not be logged.

 o) You should also consider starting syslogd with -c option.

 More information can be found at BruteForceBlocker Project site located
 at http://danger.rulez.sk/projects/bruteforceblocker.

CONFIGURATION

 All configuration is now done in separate file, usually located at
 /usr/local/etc/bruteforceblocker.conf. If not, you have to edit main
 script and put there full path to the configuration file.

 Most of values in this config should be sufficient for your
 requirements, but there's no problem to tweak them.

 o) email - email address where will be send mails when a new IP will be
            blocked. To disable emailing, set to undef, or ''
 o) table - name of the pf table in pf.conf
 o) tablefile - location of table on filesystem, specified in pf.conf
 o) max_attempts - maximum number of failed tries before blocking IP
 o) timeout - number of seconds of inactivity needed before resetting IP
              counter
 o) report - if the reporting should be enabled or not. Reporting is
             good to share your catched attackers with other people
 o) debug - enable/disable debugging
 o) use_remote - set to 1 if you want BruteForceBlocker to download
                 blacklist of IPs catched by other users and load them
                 to pf table
 o) mindays - use only those IPs from blacklist which were reported in
              last x days
 o) mincount - use only those IPs which were reported from at least x
               different source machines
 o) mail - location of mail binary used to send mails
 o) pfctl - location of pfctl binary
 o) whitelist - list of IPs that will never get blocked
