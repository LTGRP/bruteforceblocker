BruteForceBlocker v1.2.3

BruteForceBlocker is a perl script, that works along with pf - OpenBSD's
firewall (Which is also available on FreeBSD since version 5.2 is out).
It's main purpose is to block SSH bruteforce attacks via firewall.

When this script is running, it checks sshd logs from syslog and looks
for Failed Login attempts - mostly some annoying script attacks, and
counts number of such attempts.

When given IP reaches configured limit of fails, script puts this IP to
the pf's table and block any further traffic to the that box from given
IP (This also depends on your configuration in pf.conf). 

Since the version of BruteForceBlocker 1.2 it is also possible to report
blocked IPs to the project site and share your information with other
users.

If you are bored of those automated auth tries, you will be happy with
this script. BruteForceBlocker is easy to use, simple, and effective.

For installation instructions see INSTALL file.
